# PureScript By Example

PureScript is a small, strongly, statically typed programming language with expressive types, written in and inspired by Haskell, and compiling to JavaScript.

## Introduction

- In PureScript, unlike in dynamically typed languages, types exist only at _compile-time_ and have no representation at runtime.
- PureScript's type system supports type inference.
- PureScript provides a powerful form of abstraction that is fundamentally type-driven: type classes.
- PureScript provides the ability to import existing JavaScript code, by providing types for its values and functions, and then to use those functions in regular PureScript code. It also allows interoperability with other languages which target JavaScript.
